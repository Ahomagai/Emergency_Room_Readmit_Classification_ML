This project contains scripts and outputs of three different machine learning algorithms used to classify which patients would be more or less likely to be readmitted to an emergency room within 30 days. ML algorithms used were a standard battery of bagging, random forest, and XGBoost. XGBoost resulted in the best results with the highest accuracy and precision scores.
